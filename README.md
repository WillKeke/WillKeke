Designing AI-powered systems that turn awkward into belonging.

I build real-world software — and MVPs that evolve into durable products.

## Philosophy

"Embrace the headache."

Hard problems are usually the valuable ones.

I build tools I would use myself, then refine them until they’re simple enough for everyone else.
